## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of FAVMOTORS seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to: security@favmotors.pl
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline:** Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-14 days
  - Medium: 14-30 days
  - Low: 30-90 days

## Security Measures

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)

```html
Content-Security-Policy: 
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval';
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  connect-src 'self';
```

### 2. HTTP Security Headers

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### 3. Input Validation

All user inputs are validated using:
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Zod for schema validation
- Sanitization before processing

### 4. Dependencies

- Regular updates via `npm audit`
- Automated security checks via GitHub Dependabot
- Lock file (`package-lock.json`) committed

### 5. Authentication (Future)

When authentication is implemented:
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT with httpOnly cookies
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting

## Best Practices for Developers

### DO:
- ✅ Validate all user inputs
- ✅ Use environment variables for sensitive data
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated
- ✅ Follow principle of least privilege
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production
- ✅ Sanitize HTML content
- ✅ Implement rate limiting for APIs

### DON'T:
- ❌ Store secrets in code
- ❌ Use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without sanitization
- ❌ Disable CSP or security headers
- ❌ Trust user input
- ❌ Log sensitive information
- ❌ Use outdated dependencies

## Security Checklist

### Frontend Security

- [x] Content Security Policy configured
- [x] XSS protection enabled
- [x] HTTPS enforced (production)
- [x] Input validation on all forms
- [x] No sensitive data in localStorage
- [x] Secure cookies (when implemented)
- [x] CORS properly configured

### Build Security

- [x] Dependencies audited
- [x] No secrets in repository
- [x] Environment variables used
- [x] Source maps disabled in production
- [x] Error messages sanitized

### Deployment Security

- [x] HTTPS certificate valid
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] Rate limiting (when APIs added)
- [x] Monitoring enabled
- [x] Backup strategy in place

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Client-Side Only**
   - Currently no backend authentication
   - No session management
   - No server-side validation

2. **Third-Party Scripts**
   - Google Fonts loaded from external CDN
   - Consider self-hosting for stricter CSP

### Planned Improvements

1. **Phase 2: Authentication**
   - User registration/login
   - Password reset functionality
   - Email verification

2. **Phase 3: API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - API key management
   - Request signing

## Compliance

### GDPR/RODO Compliance

- ✅ Cookie consent implemented
- ✅ Privacy policy in development
- ✅ Data minimization principle
- ✅ Right to be forgotten (when auth added)

### Accessibility

- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ✅ Semantic HTML
- ✅ ARIA labels where needed
- ✅ Keyboard navigation

## Updates and Patches

### How We Handle Security Updates

1. **Vulnerability Detected**
   - Internal discovery or external report
   - Severity assessment

2. **Fix Development**
   - Patch created in private branch
   - Security testing

3. **Deployment**
   - Patch released
   - Users notified if needed
   - CVE assigned if applicable

4. **Post-Release**
   - Monitoring for issues
   - Documentation updated
